# printrospector

Deserializes ObjectProperty state into human-readable XML.

## About

ObjectProperty is KingsIsle's proprietary reflection and serialization system
for C++ classes.

It can be found all over the game, most notably in the networking protocol and
the binary `.xml` files stored in game assets.

*printrospector* is an effort to build a tool that can read and process
serialized binary data of all shapes into human-readable XML in collaboration
with the [wizwalker developers](https://github.com/StarrFox/wizwalker).
